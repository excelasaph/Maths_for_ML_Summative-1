# Linear Regression and Model Comparison

This project implements and compares different machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest. It also includes a manual implementation of Linear Regression using Gradient Descent.

## Features
- **Model Evaluation**: Compare different models based on RMSE.
- **Gradient Descent Implementation**: Compute linear regression parameters manually.
- **Normalization**: Improve gradient descent efficiency by scaling data.
- **Partial Derivatives Calculation**: Compute gradients for optimization.
