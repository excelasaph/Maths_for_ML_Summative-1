# Linear Regression and Model Comparison

This project implements and compares different machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest. It also includes a manual implementation of Linear Regression using Gradient Descent.

## Features
- **Model Evaluation**: Compare different models based on RMSE.
- **Gradient Descent Implementation**: Compute linear regression parameters manually.
- **Normalization**: Improve gradient descent efficiency by scaling data.
- **Partial Derivatives Calculation**: Compute gradients for optimization.

## Files
- `model_comparison.py` - Compares Random Forest, Decision Trees, and Linear Regression.
- `gradient_descent.py` - Implements Linear Regression using Gradient Descent.
- `README.md` - Project documentation.
